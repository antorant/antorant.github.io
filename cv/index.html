    <h1>Kind Words</h1>
    <p>“Ant is a unicorn. I’ve never been able to find another mythical being like him who can design the most simple, intuitive and beautiful user interfaces and then code them to life as well. If I would have had a magic unicorn lasso I would have never let him go.” <br/><br/>&mdash; Travis Todd. Founder, Toast / Silicon Allee</p>
    <p>“Ant is a superb professional. His good taste for design as well as the ability to question how things are made allows him to come up with amazing, clean, simple interfaces. He carried out his work with a high degree of motivation, building outstanding user experiences across platforms but, at the same time, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, creating unique Android, iOS and web designs. I wholeheartedly recommend Ant because I would not hesitate to work with him again.” <br/><br/>&mdash; Hugo Doménech Juárez. Android Developer, Moped</p>
    <p>“Ant worked at get-ctrl through a phase of rapid development. He was always able to provide thoughtful insight into the direction of the platform. He showed great pride in the work that he carried out and produced excellent results even though the toolset he was working with at the time had limitations. I would not hesitate in hiring Ant again.” <br/><br/>&mdash; Nick Holden. CEO, get-ctrl</p>
