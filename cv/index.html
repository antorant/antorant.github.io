    <h1>Kind Words</h1>
    <p><small>I've had the opportunity to work alongside Ant and to report to him for close to 1 year and I can say I enjoyed every day of it, as he treats others like he treats his work: with an open and constructive mindset, even in challenging times.
Ant managed to build and lead a motivating and caring team, where we have always been pushed to share our ideas and opinions about what we do, how we do it and why we do it. His trust in our skills and knowledge encouraged us to experiment and to be more confident in order to provide something always more refined while maintaining the quality of our daily tasks. I’m very grateful for his patience, reliability and willingness to support his team members because it made me grow as a designer but also as a person. Anyone would be lucky to get to work with Ant and I’d be more than happy to do it again.<br/>&mdash; L&eacute;a Clidassou, Brand Designer @ IDAGIO</small>
    </p>

    <p><small>Ant was one of the first hires at IDAGIO and instrumental to the design of our web app. He went on to lead our entire design efforts, redefine our brand from the ground up and establish a design system - both of which are still in use today. I particularly admire his thoughtfulness and attention to detail.<br/>&mdash; Christoph Lange, Co-founder @ IDAGIO</small>
