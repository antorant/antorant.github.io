  <h1>Dedicated mentorship for designers</h1>
  <p>Design is a difficult job. By nature our work is multidisciplinary and requires us to solve undiscovered problems, while building relationships with everyone from users to engineers to founders to other designers.</p>
  <p>Most organisations have personal development initiatives, but they often take a back seat to business goals, and the people assigned to help you usually have other priorities. Sometimes their ability to help you is constrained by politics, hierarchy or just their own naturally internal perspective.</p>
  <p>Working with a committed, independent mentor can amplify your own and your employer's efforts by providing regular and personalised opportunities for learning and reflection.</p>

  <h2>I can help you with:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Critique and feedback on your documents, presentations, wireframes and visual designs</li>
    <li>Guidance on UX processes, running workshops and project management</li>
    <li>Written and verbal communication skills</li>
    <li>Optimising your creativity and productivity</li>
    <li>Cultivating healthy relationships with managers, stakeholders, engineers and other creatives</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting interpersonal problems</li>
    <li>Managing stress and finding a healthy work-life balance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What you get:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4x 60-minute, one-to-one conversation at a cadence that suits you: monthly, twice monthly or weekly</li>
    <li>Session notes for each conversation</li>
    <li>Tools and resources relevant to your growth</li>
    <li>Live support: I'll reply to questions by text or email within 24 hours</li>
    <li>NDA-signed, total confidentiality</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

  <p>I'm Ant, I've worked as a designer for over a decade at startups, mid-size companies and as a freelancer. I've been a designer, a team lead and a director, and the most satisfaction I found was in helping others more talented than me to do their best work. I believe in the exponential power of learning, self-reflection and high-fidelity relationships, and that designers can change the world for the better at every scale.</p>
