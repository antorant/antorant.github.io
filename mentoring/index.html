  <h1>Dedicated mentoring for designers</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Design is tricky. Our work is multidisciplinary and the landscape shifts constantly. We have to solve new and undefined problems, working with everyone from customers to founders, from marketers to engineers.</p>
  <p>If you're starting out, it's not easy to find your feet among emerging disciplines and shifting role definitions. Everyone needs a designer, so you have the responsibility to choose the right projects and align your work with your values.</p>
  <p>Most design roles come with personal development plans, but they can take a back seat to business goals. The people there to help you might have other priorities, or their ability to help you might be constrained by politics or hierarchy.</p>
  <p>Working with an independent mentor can amplify your own growth efforts. With a focused feedback loop you'll learn and reflect faster, and with a committed partner you're more likely to hit your goals.</p>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <img src="../img/full.jpg" />
  <p>I'm Ant, I've worked as a designer for over a decade at startups, midsize companies and as a freelancer. I've been a designer, a team lead and a director, and the most satisfaction I found was in helping talented people to do their best work. I believe in the exponential power of learning, self-reflection and high-fidelity relationships, and that designers can change the world for the better at every scale.</p>
