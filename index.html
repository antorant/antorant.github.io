  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p><strong>I'm a maker:</strong>
  Finding the perfect balance between function and aesthetics has fascinated me ever since I was a kid. I love to build stuff that works and looks cool. I became a designer by building websites and I like to design in code.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a generalist:</strong>
  I work across design displines and try to have a functional overview of adjacent displines. I think in systems and try to connect the dots.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a practitioner:</strong>
  I'm a student of creative practice and process. I love working with creative people and applying principles of design and creativity across scales and contexts.</p>
