  <!-- <h2>Who am I?</h2> -->
  <img src="../img/full.jpg" />
  <p>I'm Ant.</p>
  <p>I’ve been making music for 25 years: playing in bands, DJing, composing, producing and releasing music.</p>
  <p>My academic training is in Fine Art practice. I’ve faced some of the challenges that occur at different stages of artistic development.</p>
  <p>In my work as a design professional, I’m tasked with understanding complex problems, making the abstract concrete, balancing creative expression with pragmatism and constraints, balancing beauty with function, and navigating essential questions of vision and purpose.</p>

  <p>As a music coach I’ve worked with Open Music Lab and Berlin Academy of Electronic Music, providing 1:1 mentoring and leading group workshops.</p>
