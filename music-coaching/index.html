  <p>I'm Ant.</p>
  <p>I’ve been making music for 25 years: playing in bands, DJing, composing, producing and releasing music. My academic training is in Fine Art practice. I’ve faced a lot of the challenges that occur to people at different stages of artistic development.</p>
  <p>In my work as a designer I’m tasked with understanding problems, making the abstract concrete, balancing expression with pragmatism, balancing beauty with function, and navigating essential questions of vision and purpose.</p>
  <p>As a music coach I’ve worked with <a href="https://www.openmusiclab.org">Open Music Lab</a> and <a href-"https://baem.studio">Berlin Academy of Electronic Music</a>, providing 1:1 mentoring and leading group workshops.</p>
