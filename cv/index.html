    <h1>Kind Words</h1>
    <p><small>&ldquo;Ant was my direct report and fellow product designer at Native Instruments. He is an incredibly gifted designer in ways that go far beyond pushing pixels. He thinks deeply about whatever he is working on and consistently collaborates to incorporate feedback from all sides. Ant is attentive to detail and knows how to deliver beautiful and effective design under pressure. His passionate approach and calm demeanor are a fantastic combination that would make him a great fit for any role he sets his sights on!&rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Mike Elfenbein, Lead UI/UX Designer @ Native Instruments & Izotope</small></p>
    <p><small>&ldquo;Ant was one of the first hires at IDAGIO and instrumental to the design of our web app. He went on to lead our entire design efforts, redefine our brand from the ground up and establish a design system - both of which are still in use today. I particularly admire his thoughtfulness and attention to detail.&rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Christoph Lange, Co-founder @ IDAGIO</small>
    <p><small>&ldquo;I've had the opportunity to work alongside Ant and to report to him for close to 1 year and I can say I enjoyed every day of it, as he treats others like he treats his work: with an open and constructive mindset, even in challenging times.
Ant managed to build and lead a motivating and caring team, where we have always been pushed to share our ideas and opinions about what we do, how we do it and why we do it. His trust in our skills and knowledge encouraged us to experiment and to be more confident in order to provide something always more refined while maintaining the quality of our daily tasks. I’m very grateful for his patience, reliability and willingness to support his team members because it made me grow as a designer but also as a person. Anyone would be lucky to get to work with Ant and I’d be more than happy to do it again.&rdquo;<br/>&mdash; L&eacute;a Clidassou, Brand Designer @ IDAGIO</small>
