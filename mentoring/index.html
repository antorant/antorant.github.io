  <p>I've worked as a designer for over a decade at startups, midsize companies and as a freelancer. I've been an individual contributor, a team lead and a director, and the most satisfaction I found was in helping talented people to do their best work. I believe in learning, self-knowledge, relationships, and individuals.</p>
