  <h1>Mentoring for designers</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Design is a difficult job. By nature our work is multidisciplinary and requires us to solve new, undefined problems while building relationships with everyone from customers to founders to engineers to other designers.</p>
  <p>Most organisations have personal development initiatives, but they often take a back seat to business goals, and the people assigned to help you usually have other priorities. Sometimes their ability to help you is constrained by politics, hierarchy or just their own naturally internal perspective.</p>
  <p>Working with a committed, independent mentor can amplify your own and your employer's efforts by providing regular and personalised opportunities for learning and reflection.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>What you get:</h2>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <img src="img/full.jpg" />
  <p>I'm Ant, I've worked as a designer for over a decade at startups, midsize companies and as a freelancer. I've been a designer, a team lead and a director, and the most satisfaction I found was in helping talented people to do their best work. I believe in the exponential power of learning, self-reflection and high-fidelity relationships, and that designers can change the world for the better at every scale.</p>
