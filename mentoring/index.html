  <p>Most roles come with personal development plans, but they can take a back seat to business goals. The people there to help you might have other priorities, or their ability to help you might be constrained by politics or hierarchy.</p>
  <p>Working with an independent mentor will amplify your own growth efforts. You'll learn and reflect faster, and you're more likely to hit your goals.</p>

  <p>I'm Ant, I've worked as a designer for over a decade at startups, midsize companies and as a freelancer. I've been an individual contributor, a team lead and a director, and the most satisfaction I found was in helping talented people to do their best work. I believe in the exponential power of learning, self-reflection and authentic relationships, and that individuals can change the world for the better at every scale.</p>
