  <p>Hi, I'm Ant.</p>
  <p>At <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/">Native Instruments</a> I work on concepts and workflows for music creation hardware.</p>
  <p>With <a href="https://wavepaths.com/">Wavepaths</a> I helped the founding team refine and evolve their brand identity, and helped the product team ship version one.</p>
  <p>At <a href="https://www.idagio.com/">Idagio</a> I helped to build and scale a music streaming service, then led product and brand design teams.
  <p>Since 2010 Iâ€™ve worked as an interdisciplinary designer:</p>

    <li>Product and brand strategy</li>

  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p><strong>I'm a maker:</strong>
  The process of finding the perfect balance between function and aesthetics has fascinated me ever since I was a kid. I love to build stuff that works and looks cool. I studied art and began my career building websites: I'm happy working with paper, pixels or code.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a generalist:</strong>
  I work across multiple design displines and aim to have a functional understanding of adjacent displines. I think in systems and connect the dots.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a practitioner:</strong>
  I'm a student of creative practice and process. I love working with creative people and I'm interested in applying principles of design and creativity across different scales and contexts.</p>
