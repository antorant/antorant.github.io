  <h1>About</h1>

  <p><strong>I'm a maker:</strong>
  Finding the perfect balance between function and aesthetics has fascinated me ever since I was a kid. I love to build stuff that works and looks cool. I studied art and began my career building websites: I'm happy working with paper, pixels or code.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a generalist:</strong>
  I work across multiple design displines and aim to have a functional understanding of adjacent displines. I think in systems and connect the dots.</p>

  <p><strong>I'm a practitioner:</strong>
  I'm a student of creative practice and process. I love working with creative people and I'm interested in applying principles of design and creativity across different scales and contexts.</p>
